Week 6 tasks: 

Delving into lists and tuples introduces the concept of mutable and immutable structures in Python. Lists, marked by their mutability, allow for alterations to 
their elements—additions, removals, or modifications—while tuples, immutable by nature, remain fixed once they're created, prohibiting any changes to their 
elements.
