Week 4 tasks: 
Working with functions involves creating reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks. By using function calls, you can execute these blocks of code 
whenever needed, making your programs modular and easier to manage. Modular programming involves breaking down complex tasks into smaller, more manageable 
functions, which can be called as needed. This approach improves code readability, maintainability, and reusability by organizing functionalities into distinct
modules or functions.
