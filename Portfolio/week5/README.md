Week 5 tasks:

Learning about scripts and modules in programming involves understanding how to organize and structure your code. A script is typically a standalone file 
containing executable code, while modules are reusable pieces of code that can be imported into other scripts or modules to provide specific functionalities.
Importing modules in Python can be done in various ways. The import statement is the most common method, allowing you to bring in an entire module or specific 
functions/classes from a module. Additionally, there's the from ... import ... syntax, which enables importing specific components directly into your script's 
namespace without using the module's name as a prefix.
