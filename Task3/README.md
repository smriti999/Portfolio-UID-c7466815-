This is a simple Python program for user management. It provides basic functionality to add users, delete users, 
allow users to login, and change passwords. The program is designed to run in a console or terminal environment.

-Login: Allows a user to log in.

-Change Password: Enables a user to change their password.

-Quit: Exits the program.
